# BUG LOG
revealAdjacent fails, in the else if statement it doesn't check to see if the col and row are in bounds 
revealAdjacent is also recursive and keeps going vs. only showing the adjacent boxes, I do not think that is how it is supposed to work
isSafe fails to show if a area is safe but works if there is a mine
issafe fails to tell us if the location is out of bounds
